Most geometry files are in 3mf files. The Cura 4.13.1 project files start with "Cura" and also contain the geometry files. If geometry files are newer than Cura files, update the relevant files in the cura project.

Update 2024-03: RevA added for wing 0-3 and for fuselage. Changes:
- Servo wire channel position improved
- Aileron servo bay position improved
- Fuse reinforcement channels for 2 mm CF rods instead of 1.5 mm
